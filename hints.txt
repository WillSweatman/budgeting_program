Handy tips:

    You can click within the scrollbars, either side of the slider,
    to make fine adjustments to your ratios.

    Within the treeview, as well as sorting by the column values,
    you can drag and drop your individual exenses into whatever
    order you like. The original order is tracked by the iid column
    so you can always sort via that column to get back to where you
    started.

    Use the Colour input in the expenses treeview to group different
    expense types. For example, red could signify transport, green
    shopping, and so on.

    If near the bottom of the treeview, and wanting to send a selected
    item to the top, drag it down to the bottom and it will jump to the
    top.
